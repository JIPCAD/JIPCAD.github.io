# Q&A
Here are some frequently encountered problems for beginners of the JIPCAD.

### Q1: Are there any interactive text editor for NOME Language?
Unfortunately, we do not have an interactive text editor for the NOME Language. However, we do have a language extension for NOME on Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded at the following website:

Also useful: github repo link:

### Q2: How does error reporting work?
Error reporting comes along with the NOME3 executable itself. The command line window pop-up from the NOME3 executable file will display the error reporting right before crash.
