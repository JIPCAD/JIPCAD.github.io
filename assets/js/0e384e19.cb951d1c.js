Thus, we have developed a new modeling tool, called JIPCAD (Joint-Interactive-Procedural CAD), that extends NOME by re-implementing it on a more robust, well-structured code base and by enhancing the library of predefined shape generators. Many additional modification modes were added to the graphical user interface, and the means of saving those changes and appending it to the original procedural JIPCAD file were improved. The challenges involved are not only generating the shapes and preserving their hierarchical relationships, but also saving interactive changes back into the code for reuse.
